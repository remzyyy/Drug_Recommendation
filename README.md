## 📋 Project Overview
This major project combines disease prediction and drug recommendation using machine learning and NLP techniques. The system analyzes patient drug reviews to provide data-driven insights for healthcare decisions.

Based on research paper: "An Intelligent Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation Prototype by Using Multiple Approaches of Machine Learning Algorithms" by Suvendu Kumar Nayak et al.

## 🌟 Features
- ML-powered disease prediction from symptoms
- Drug recommendation based on patient reviews
- Sentiment analysis of drug reviews
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Data visualization of predictions
- Multi-condition classification system


### Dataset Features
- 215,063 patient drug reviews
- Patient condition information
- 10-star rating system
- Timestamps and usefulness ratings
- Detailed patient experiences
